# Movie Recommender System
## Overview
This project is a movie recommender system built using data from two Kaggle datasets: movies.csv and credits.csv. The system leverages text data and similarity metrics to provide movie recommendations based on user input. The implementation is done in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Datasets
1. movies.csv: Contains information about movies such as title, genres, and overview.
2. credits.csv: Contains information about the cast and crew of each movie.

```
2. Jupyter Notebook:
Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed and running. You can install Jupyter Notebook using pip if you don't have it:
